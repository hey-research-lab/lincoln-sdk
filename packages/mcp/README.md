# @lincolnprotocol/mcp

MCP server that gives an AI agent its own private balance on Robinhood Chain through [Lincoln](https://lincolnprotocol.com). It can hold ETH, dollars and tokenized stocks, and send, swap and withdraw them. Proofs are generated on your machine and a relayer submits them, so the agent's wallet never appears on chain.

```sh
# 1. Create the agent wallet (encrypted with your passphrase)
export LINCOLN_PASSPHRASE='…'
npx @lincolnprotocol/cli init

# 2. Connect your client
claude mcp add lincoln -e LINCOLN_PASSPHRASE="$LINCOLN_PASSPHRASE" -- npx -y @lincolnprotocol/mcp
codex mcp add lincoln --env LINCOLN_PASSPHRASE="$LINCOLN_PASSPHRASE" -- npx -y @lincolnprotocol/mcp
```

Other clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor and others):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lincoln": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@lincolnprotocol/mcp"],
      "env": { "LINCOLN_PASSPHRASE": "…" }
    }
  }
}
```

Tools: `lincoln_balance`, `lincoln_address`, `lincoln_pools`, `lincoln_policy`, `lincoln_activity`, `lincoln_status`, `lincoln_quote`, and `lincoln_send` / `lincoln_swap` / `lincoln_withdraw` / `lincoln_deposit`, which take a `quoteId`, never raw amounts.

Spends are checked against `~/.lincoln/policy.json` (per-transaction, daily and approval limits). Those limits are enforced by this software, not by the contracts, so keep only what the agent needs in its balance.
